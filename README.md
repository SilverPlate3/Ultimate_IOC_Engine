# Ultimate_IOC_Engine
Stop relying only on VirusTotal!!!  Search IOC's and local files against the TOP 6 IOC engines in one click. Get the results parsed and see ONLY the valuable data. 



# How to start it 
This project is a Plug-and-play. You just need to download the full folder as it is and initiate the GUI.py file.



# API Keys
I gifted the project users, with 1 API key for each IOC engine.  
Some API key's have a max of 4 queries a minute and 500 a day. If you are planing to only use the "built in" Keys you may have an issue, especially if other people use them as well. I suggest you add at least 2 API keys for each IOC engine.
After that you should remove the "built in" API Key!

###How can you add API key's?  
↓  
1) Create a user for each of the IOC engines. This will take you 10 minutes.
